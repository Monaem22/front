                <p><b>Tourism in Turkey </b>is focused largely on a variety of historical sites, and on seaside resorts
                    along its Aegean and Mediterranean Sea coasts. Turkey has also become a popular destination for
                    culture, spa, and health care.

                    At its height in 2019, Turkey attracted around<mark> 51 million foreign tourists</mark>,[1] ranking
                    as the
                    sixth-most-popular tourist destination in the world.[2] The total number fluctuated between around

            <div class="p2">

                <p>
                    Istanbul is one of the most important tourism spots not only in Turkey but also in the world. There
                    are thousands of hotels and other tourist-oriented industries in the city. Turkey's largest city,
                    Istanbul has a number of major attractions derived from its historical status as capital of the
                    Byzantine and Ottoman Empires. These include<strong> the Sultan Ahmed Mosque (the "Blue
                        Mosque")</strong>, the Hagia
                    Sophia, the Topkapı Palace, the Basilica Cistern, the Dolmabahçe Palace, the Galata Tower, the Grand
                    Bazaar, the Spice Bazaar, and the Pera Palace Hotel. Istanbul has also recently become one of the
                    biggest shopping centers of the European region by hosting malls and shopping centers, such as
                    Metrocity, Akmerkez and Cevahir Mall, which is the biggest mall in Europe and seventh largest
                    shopping center in the world. Other attractions include sporting events, museums, and cultural
                    events.

                    <mark>In January 2013</mark>, the Turkish government announced that it would build the world's
                    largest airport in
                    Istanbul. The operation has an invested 7-billion euros and was planned to have the first part of a
                    four-part plan completed by 2017.[8]

                    As a consequence of the continuous fall in tourism to Turkey in recent years, as of October 2016 in
                    Istanbul's famous bazaar once crowded shopping streets are not as crowded as before, "the streams of
                    tourists who used to visit the market each day have trickled to a halt."[3] The number of foreign
                    tourists visiting Istanbul declined to<mark> 9.2 million in 2016</mark>, a 26 percent decrease
                    compared to
                    2015.[9]

            <div class="p4">
                <p>
                    Ankara : [ˈaŋkaɾa] (About this
                    soundlisten)),[a] historically known as Ancyra[b] and Angora,[8][c] is the capital of Turkey.
                    Located in the central part of Anatolia, the city has a population of 4.5 million in its urban
                    center and over 5.6 million in Ankara Province,[10] making it Turkey's second-largest city after
                    Istanbul.

                    Serving as the capital of the ancient Celtic state of<strong> Galatia </strong><mark>(280–64
                        BC)</mark>, and later of the Roman
                    province with the same name (25 BC–7th century), the city is very old with various Hattian, Hittite,
                    Lydian, Phrygian, Galatian, Greek, Persian, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman archeological sites. The
                    Ottomans made the city the capital first of <strong>the Anatolia Eyalet </strong><mark>(1393–late
                        15th century)</mark>, and then
                    <strong>the Angora Vilayet </strong><mark>(1867–1922)</mark>. The historical center of Ankara is a
                    rocky hill rising 150 m (500
                    ft) over the left bank of the Ankara River, a tributary of the Sakarya River. The hill remains
                    crowned by the ruins of Ankara Castle. Although few of its outworks have survived, there are
                    well-preserved examples of Roman and Ottoman architecture throughout the city, the most remarkable
                    being the 20 BC Temple of Augustus and Rome that boasts the Monumentum Ancyranum, the inscription
                    recording the Res Gestae Divi Augusti.[11]

                    <mark> On 23 April 1920</mark>, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey was established in Ankara,
                    which became the
                    headquarters of the Turkish National Movement during the Turkish War of Independence. Ankara became
                    the new Turkish capital upon the establishment of the Republic on 29 October 1923, succeeding in
                    this role the former Turkish capital Istanbul following the fall of the Ottoman Empire. The
                    government is a prominent employer, but Ankara is also an important commercial and industrial city,
                    located at the center of Turkey's road and railway networks. The city gave its name to the Angora
                    wool shorn from Angora rabbits, the long-haired Angora goat (the source of mohair), and the Angora
                    cat. The area is also known for its pears, honey and muscat grapes. Although situated in one of the
                    driest regions of Turkey and surrounded mostly by steppe vegetation (except for the forested areas
                    on the southern periphery), Ankara can be considered a green city in terms of green areas per
                    inhabitant, at 72 square meters (775 square feet) per head.[12]
